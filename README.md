# cicd-terraform-aws-jenkins-pipeline
CICD Jenkins Pipeline which will be deploying a Terraform Architecture, using the following stages - Checkout, Verification, Test and Deploy.

This project will create:

VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
2 subnets (public) with CIDR 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24
An autoscaling group with Amazon Linux 2 instance (t2.micro) with a minimum of 2 instances and a max of 3

# Architecture
This architecture displays the Pipeline stages - Checkout, Build, Test, Deploy.

# Prerequisites
* An AWS Account with an IAM user capable of creating resources â€“ `AdminstratorAccess`
* A locally configured AWS profile for the above IAM user
* Terraform installation - [steps](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
* AWS EC2 key pair - [steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
* Virtualbox installation - [steps](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 

# How to Apply/Destroy
This section details the deployment and teardown of the architecture. **Warning: this will create AWS resources that costs money**

## Jenkins Installation 

### 1. `jenkins-docker-installation` GitHub Repo
To run a Jenkins Docker Container and to then perform the initial Jenkins installation setup, please access the following `jenkins-docker-installation` GitHub Repo and follow the instructions within the README.md file -

## Deploy Terraform Architecture using Jenkins Pipeline
Now we have a created Pipeline, we can finally select 'Build Now' to set the Pipeline build process in motion -

Update Image 2

The Pipeline has successfully gone through the build, test, push and deployment phases and the EC2 instance should now be accessible -
